# Initial data format should be as follows:

`id > item > type`, which includes the following types:

__onom__ :: onomastic data (names)
__onto__ :: toponimic onomastic data (toponymic names)
__topo__ :: toponymic data (toponyms)

`date` should be replace with the following:
__yebi__ :: year of birth
__yede__ :: year of death (this one will help to cound individuals, as there are often many dates in a biography)
__yemi__ :: years of other kind (not categorized)
 
# Enriching Layers
In `R`, the initial data is to be split into subvariables () and expanded with  `enriching layers` that will provide additional analytical data, such as transliteration, translation, categorization (metacategories, synonyms, etc), coordinates, etc.

title: "About This Website"

**NB** to re-generate the site, run `R -e 'library("rmarkdown");library("knitr");rmarkdown::render_site()'` (from the folder!)

This is a prototype of an exploratorium for biographical data from Arabic biographical collections. There is a series of valuable materials online that have been (or will be) consulted for the development of the following template, which include the following:

1. [Plotly Book[down]](https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/)
2. [Rmarkdown Documentation (html)](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#overview)
3. [Rmarkdown Documentation (website building)](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html)
4. [Coppelia Blog](http://www.coppelia.io/blog/) has some interesting things on R > D3 (actually, the library `R2D3`)
5. [A curated guide to the best tools, resources and technologies for data visualization](http://dataviz.tools/)

# R-things

1. Network analysis in `R`: perhaps I could identify communities and then push data through `networkD3`?
2. ...

## Notes for further development

1. Experiment with other visualizations and graphs
2. Package code into functions for easier reuse.


## Other types of graphs and possible usage

1. `Dendrograms` can be used to visualize the classifications of names, toponyms and other entities.
2. Bar charts can supplement the map, to reinforce spatial distribution

## Required data

1. *NisbaÅ§* data table (build from Cohen, Schatzmayer and Petry)
2. Gazetteer data need to be supplemented by entries on regions (develop the logic of processing regions > dynamic assignment of coordinates of the dominant urban center)
3. What else?

# Data model --- Description

Initial data format should be as follows: `id > item > type`, which includes the following types:

- __onom__ :: onomastic data (names)
- __onto__ :: toponymic onomastic data (toponymic names, goes into `onom` and `topo`)
- __topo__ :: toponymic data (toponyms)

`date` should be replace with the following:

- __yebi__ :: year of birth
- __yede__ :: year of death (this one will help to cound individuals, as there are often many dates in a biography)
- __yemi__ :: years of other kind (not categorized)

`misc` layer to accommodate other random things.
 
**Enriching Layers**: In `R`, the initial data is to be split into subvariables (`onom`, `topo`, `date`, `dade`, `misc`) and expanded with  `enriching layers` that will provide additional analytical data, such as transliteration, translation, categorization (metacategories, synonyms, etc), coordinates, etc.

**Network layers**: The edges should be pre-generated, and then either enriched in `R` or during the pre-generation stage.
